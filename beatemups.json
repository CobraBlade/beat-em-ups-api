Both games share the Chicken-Leg enemy.The characters in Streets of Rage II are named similarly to Golden Axe's fighters. Compare Axel Stone to Ax=Battler, Blaze Fielding to Tyris Flare, and Max Thunder to Gilius Thunderhead.Golden Axe uses scream samples from the following films: Commando, Rambo: First Blood, Conan the Barbarian, and An American Werewolf in London.Golden Axe uses a unique \"Strength\" system rather than a traditional score. It's calculated as follows:\nStrength = ((0.5 + 0.5L) * E * A) * M. L is the current level you're on (1-5). E is for Enemy. Normal enemies count as 1, bosses are 2, and Death=adder is 8. A is for the attack you kill the enemy with. Banging the top of their head followed by a kick is 3, a normal kick or throw is 2, and anything else is 1. Finally, this is multiplied by M, your Magic Multiplier (see below.) At the end of the game, your Strength for all kills is aggregated and then divided by the number of times you died to calculate your final score.It is possible to increase your Strength by skillfully using magic. After you kill an enemy, every time you hit them with magic afterwards multiplies your Strength. If you line up a row of Pots and quickly use magic before the enemy hits the ground, you can achieve ridiculously high Strength scores.",

        "platform": "ARC",
        "about": "\n\nKnights of the Round is a hack 'n' slash brawler from Capcom. It innovates in no less than four ways: it introduced a blocking mechanic that grants temporary invincibility, your character gains experience and changes appearance, items can be broken up and shared, and killing the same type of enemy consecutively grants a bonus. It also has a one-of-a-kind melodic medieval soundtrack.\n",
        "trivia": "Knights of the Round is the least similar to Final Fight out of all Capcom's brawlers. Besides a death-blow attack, Knights of the Round distances itself from Capcom's genre-dominating classic by focusing on weapons-based combat against relatively few enemies and emphasizing advanced techniques.Every large item can be broken up into smaller pieces by attacking it. With the exception of the Salad, which can possibly go down in value, every other item grants more total points when broken apart. Do your best to attack every item and only grab it right away if it's about to disappear.Knights of the Round is the only brawler (and one of the few games, ever) where you change appearance as you level up. It's also the only arcade brawler with an experience system, although a small handful of console brawlers (most notably Double Dragon on NES) also use XP.Knights of the Round has a unique combo system. Killing the same type of enemy in a row multiplies the score by up to x4. Using this is key to leveling up all the way. In multiplayer games, everybody shares the same combo counter. Therefore, it's important to talk with your friends and try to kill enemies in the best order possible. Of course, this is hard if your friends suck at games.Knights of the Round has a unique blocking system that is unlike any other game. When you block an enemy's attack, you actually gain a few seconds of complete invincibility that you can use to punish the enemy with powerful attacks. Although blocking drags down almost every other brawler it's present in (see River City Ransom or Guardian Heroes), Knights of the Round does it right.",
